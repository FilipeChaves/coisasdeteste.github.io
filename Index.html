			<p class="texto"> Our Concept is to bring feelings and sounds from the recent past back to life in a very friendly atmosphere through special outdoor gatherings.
			<br>Events where energy and communication flow in a retro-futuristic way.
			<br>A unique location, under the shade of trees, in the middle of nature, built with love by dancers for dancers. 
			All the musicians on stage are active members of the global trance scene, and have careers which started back in the 90's. 
			We believe that the most important ingredient in a party are the participants, everyone is a part of it, everyone makes the gathering! Collective energy gives wings to a gathering, your presence makes it magical.</p>

			<p class="textoBold conceptColor"> SO, WHAT DOES ZNA STANDS FOR?</p>
			<p class="texto"> ZNA is the Zeoxyribonucleic Acid.
			<br>ZNA is a strand that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all Zambu living organisms.
			<br>It's similar to what you may know as DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
			<br>But there is a slight difference.
			<br>Some of us have been exposed to huge amounts of psychedelic emotions back in the nineties, many of us in the famous "fluoresta do Zambujal", where countless parties, and the 3 first editions of the Boom festival took place.
			<br>These people are referred to as "ZambujAliens" or "Zambu".
			<br>In this magic place and situation, many of us re-activated this extra link in our molecular sequence, and nothing was the same, ever again.
			<br>The Zambu share a ritual in which dancers are the main ingredients, and where it is all about the collective experience influencing the perception of the self and generating Love trough Art, Dance and togetherness.
			<br>The ZNA is the specific genetic code of the Zambu people.
			<br>The bearers of this genetic mutation have a special type of awareness and vibration.
			<br>This gene has been passed on to many others, by direct contact with the special Zambu vibrational pattern.
			<br>The worldwide expansion of this genetic sequence has been the case for many studies.
			<br>Some ancient astronaut theorists believe this gene has come to us from outer space.
			<br>It has been with us before in ancient times, in all the rituals of trance dance known to ancient Man.
			<br>It was laying dormant for a few centuries, but it found us again...
			<br>This whole theory is what inspired us to breathe life into this concept, turning it into a reality
			<br>Let us all reawaken our ZNA</p>

				<p class="texto">Dedicated to psychill ambient and downtempo sounds. This area invites softer moments in a cosy psychedelic nest. The Chillout Area is designed and built with the aim to achieve ultimate comfort and relaxation. With consideration towards the different stages of Chill,  our Chill master has developed the idea to create 3 different layers inside this stage, which are: The Chill In, The Chill Out and The Sleep Out.
				<br>The Chill In will be the area for soft, downtempo dancing. 
				<br>The Chill Out will be the perfect spot to sit, have a drink, relax and listen to the music while communicating with those around you. 
				<br>The Sleep Out is meant for those who feel like slumbering away comfortably in the arms of music, never losing touch with the party. 
				<br>The musical program is designed to meet specific levels of relaxation at specific times of the day, always in tune with the rest of the gathering.

				<p class="texto">We are aware that many of our party rockers are in a moment on their journey where they have this wonderful and unique gift called family. And as your family is our family we want them to feel safe, comfortable and happy to be in our Gathering.
				<br>As such, we developed an area dedicated to the young ones. Here you can choose to participate in activities together with your children at no cost.
				<br>We guarantee a lot of fun and joy for everyone involved. The team for this area was selected for their dedication, love and last but not least - professionalism and experience, in order to give your family an impeccable service.
				<br>
				<br>For this edition we invited a very special group to be responsible for the ZambuKids area and we have no doubt that they will embrace this project making it very colourful and fun. 
				<br>This is the same group that founded the Kids Eco Village called Quinta do Sol which has been one of Ana Banana’s life projects. She is also the founder of  “Escola do Riso” (Laughter School) and author of the best seller: Laugh Now. Together with awesome people who share the same passion for the future of our kids, they’ve been building one of the most amazing projects where being happy, free and successful is what these kids learn to be as they grow.  
				<br>
				<br>Kids are the future of our ZNA!!
				<br>
				<br>So we invite you to bring them and make them part of the ZNA experience!</p>
				<p class="textoBold programColor">Zambu Kids will be open every day from 10:30am to 08:00pm.</p>
				<p class="textoBold programColor">There you will find many activities such as:</p>
				<p class="texto">Cooperative games, Acrobatics, Theatre, Laughter Yoga, Treasure Hunt, Parachute Games, Laughter Yoga, Giant Totems, Crazy Willow Baskets, Making Puppets and Show, Wood carving with kid friendly knives, Making Felt, Bamboo art, Giant Chinese Dragon, Puppet Show, Story Telling, Comical Play, Circus, Puppet Show, Soap Bubble Show, Carnival and many other fun stuff...
				</p>

				<p class="texto">This is a free service provided by a partnership between ZNA Gathering and Kids Eco Village - Quinta do Sol. Their project is extremely valuable and for that reason we would like to appeal to your contribution with any kind of donation through their website or in the ZambuKids area during the festival.</p>

				<p class="texto">After 6 days of intense retro psychedelic exposure you might find yourself merging into that magical state in which you feel exhausted but at the same time renewed, ready to accept a new state of consciousness, full of clarity and focus. Focus on the “we” instead of the “me”.
				<br>So as the true party animals that we are, we’d like to challenge you to celebrate one extra night/day surrounded by funky soundscapes with an open mindset intended on sharing amazing feelings of togetherness and pure happiness. 
				<br>If you are one of the resistant ones, who chooses to stay with us until the very end, you can expect to witness the performances from Trance’s old schoolers who also choose to explore alternative genres within the psychedelic spectrum such as deep house, minimal and progressive techno. 
				<br>This moment will be, in our perspective, the perfect closure to such an intense Gathering- So we invite you all to stay tuned for more information on this after-party</p>

				<p class="texto">We have chosen the shadiest area of the ZNA Land to provide comfort for all Zambu campers.
				<br>You are welcome to bring your tent and use this area to build your nest. 
				<br>Do not ever forget it is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN TO USE FIRE in any form, anywhere on the ZNA Land. 
				<br>Empower your green consciousness by using the multiple garbage bins around the land.</p>

				<p class="texto">This area will have toilets and showers. Make sure you only bring biodegradable cosmetics (shampoo, soap etc)</p>

				<p class="textoBold infoColor">SHOWER POLICY:</p>

				<p class="texto">The showers are supplied with the same mineral water you can find in any tap at the Gathering. Once you use that water for bathing, it is collected in tanks.
				<br>The water is then pumped and transported to water treatment facility, many kilometres away. This is a strenuous and costly task, but one we take on seriously and with great resolve.
				<br>We care for your comfort, and mother nature’s preservation, so we kindly ask you to use the shower water wisely, and make sure you use only biodegradable shampoos, soaps, etc.  
				<br>Please save shower water!
				<br>Be responsible!</p>

				<div class="historyBig StageImage"></div>
				<p class="texto">These meetings are a consequence of the reconnection of many of the old school party people trough social media.
				<br>An online group was created in 2010 and it became clear that there were more than just a few old Zambu souls out there craving for a proper old school gathering.
				<br>Five parties have been done already under the ZNA motto, and their energy and vibration are still echoing in our hearts and souls.
				<br>Along this journey we were guided by our hearts, and supported by all our Zambu friends, both on stage and on the dancefloor.
				<br>We have had the privilege to host many of the best artists in the scene, all people we appreciate in an artistic and personal way. For us it’s about highlighting the energy and vibration off all the participants.
				<br>The result is a universal meeting point for old school trance lovers that take place in the ZNA Gathering every 2 years.
				<br>The dancers are the energy; the dancers are the key…
				<br>Our crew is a small group of trance heads who have been living and working in this scene for the last 20 years all around the world. We have been at the birth of many parties and festivals across time. It’s in our genes by now, in our ZNA…

				<br>So: more space, more Art, more comfort.</p>

				<p class="textoBold ticketsColor">The tickets for the ZNA Gathering are limited. We are focused on keeping a familiar and cosy vibe, characterized by quality and comfort. This means there will be a maximum of 6000 tickets available.

					<br>Why? Because he is known for creating night stompers used during the crazy hours when our mind is running inside the huge, complex and psychedelic maze formed in our perception while this musical wizard is playing.
					<br>This wicked wizard is David Tingsgard best known, since the late 90´s,  as The Battle Of The Future Buddhas, one of the marvel producers of the funky and bombastic BOOM Records.
					<br>Be prepared, because David is truly committed to keeping the night at ZNA Raw, Wild and Psychedelic.
					<br>This is the type of moment we love to generate, a flight into the powerful arms of strong, meaningful music.
					<br>We are sure you are up for it!

						Martin comes directly from the headquarters of Iboga records and is considered as one of the pioneers and one of the finest Danish musicians within this style.
						<br>Martin aka Beat Bizarre, turned the paradigm of Psychedelic trance upside down in the end of the 90´s by releasing his 1st vinyl which "instead of using the ecstatic melodies of classic Trance productions, its hypnotic power evolves from booming basses and tight percussion, from subliminal rhythmic build-ups, and from a multitude of grinding and jangling sounds that merge into a perfectly sleek groove".
						<br>Even though he has been exploring different musical approaches, at the ZNA he will deliver a special 2 hours live set that will take us apart and reunite us again in psychedelic glory. 
						<br>All of us will be invited to re-set our minds in order to explore the realms of psychedelia which await us all during the hours of the night.

						Miranda is a female producer who is dubbed by many as the Queen of trance. Since the early 90´s Miranda earned the title of the very 1st solo female GoaTrance producer. The feminine energy is an extremely energetic and positive one, characterized by its creativity and power.
						<br>It is not easy to find a female musician who is also a computer nerd, who chooses to dedicate her time combining the two. She did so, and the result helped to implant the roots of our trance history.
						<br>We believe that her sensitivity combined with her vision of a proper psychedelic experience through digital music were the reason for the birth of many of the most uplifting tracks to ever hit the dancefloors.
						<br>Actually we know for a fact that when she is in the perfect mood and playing at the right time for the right crowd. She has the rare ability to provoke a euphoric state on a dancefloor, creating one of those special moments of oneness we all aim to experience time after time.
						<br>We all know she likes to explore all genres inside the psy trance spectrum. However, at the ZNA she will greet us with her majestic uplifting side, showing us once again all her beauty and power.

						<h3 class="titulo-infinity" >THE INFINITY PROJECT by Graham Wood</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="texto">
						This is one of the projects that founded the mythical label named TIP (The Infinity Project) Records back in 1994.
						<br>This project was born in the late 80's, when Raja Ram and Graham Wood joined forces creating music for all the acid heads who were thirsty for new underground futuristic psychedelic music. At the time, this was really hard thing to find...
						<br>Together with their closest friends, such as Martin Freeland (MWNN), Simon Posford (Hallucinogen) and Nick Barber (Doof) they created, for almost 10 years, flawless music under The Infinity Project. During all this time they fed the minds of many of the true Goa trance rockers of that generation, helping them to experience new sensations and to push the boundaries of reality and musical perception.
						<br>In 1998 Raja Ram and Graham Wood agreed to split up in order to concentrate their creativity on other musical projects. However, here and there, they both accepted to perform as The Infinity Project.
						<br>Each one had his own vision within the universe of TIP, and as such the 2 interpretations of The Infinity Project, grew in different directions, becoming very different from each other.
						<br>For our next edition we chose to experience The Infinity Project by Graham Wood which will be focused on all the early material and on TIP's first steps as a Goa Trance label. During his performance you can expect a lot of music produced from that time but was never released as well as all their classics such as "Feeling Very Weird", "Brain Bokka" and "Hyperspaced" among others...
						<br>Graham will delight us all with a long journey of his downtempo chill out psychedelic vision on the chill stage, this will be a moment no one should miss…

					<br>The journey will begin with Space Cat/DNA’s early work where his majestic melodies are focused on embracing us all throughout the late morning hours in which unique sounds are meant to shape our feelings.
					<br>The next man will present us with a precious retrospective set resulting from a careful selection, celebrating the roots of our scene. During this set we will be exposed to Oforia, Solaris, Pigs in Space & Tandu’s finest timeless melodies - however he felt something was missing and that this would not be enough.
					<br>So to do something that has never been tested before, he will also present us with new grooves in his set and the all time classic remixes he is working on at this precise moment. It will be a moment for a unique subtle metallic feeling directly connected to the roots of our scene.
					<br>Last but not least, these 2 deck wizards will join forces on stage as they did decades ago, to share with us, all the work they have been doing with their Indoor & Phreaky projects during the last 20 years which we believe will be one of those moments we will want to relive for years to come.

					He will, once again, give us the immense honour of dancing through his musical ritual shaped and designed by one of the biggest music collections ever experienced in the scene.    
					<br>There will be no ready-made formulas, no top 10 tracks... Instead, he will invite us to explore with him a deep, emotional and uplifting trance voyage through the golden years of the progressive psy trance music. 
					<br>He does what few DJs do: he goes up there without a clue of what his set will be. He just knows how it will start. He makes sure to arrive way before the start of his performance. This way he has enough time to experience the vibe and connect with the dancefloor before taking over the hearts and minds of dancers.

					Paul Baguley and Sonya Bailey have been producing electronic music as ManMadeMan since 1994.
					<br>Both artists came from completely different musical backgrounds. Paul was working with bands and Sonya was a wayward young girl with a keen ear. Coming together they partied hard at some of the most legendary events back in the early days, Cripps Barn, Dragon Fly, The Fridge, The Rocket and Space Hopper, the club that launched them. It was these experiences that inspired them to create music within a scene that was totally different from anything they had been involved in before.
					<br>Together, they worked alongside many producers and have played at a wide range of events across the world.
					<br>Since the first time they performed for us, we knew that their music and energy was a must have in our celebrations. And if in the last edition, they started off where they had left us in the previous edition (2013), this year they will go back in time, and bring back to life their 90’s Goa Trance side, exclusively for us.

					We aim to choose artists we believe are the best at doing what they love. So, it´s no surprise that we chose one who has a commitment to electronic music since the early 90s. Not only did he witness the evolution of Trance and the rise of all its sub-genres, he was partof this process, becoming one of its driving forces. 
					<br>Browsing through Mapusa Mapusa’s impressive release and collection catalogue is like reading an exciting story about the infinite possibilities of rhythm and sound.
					<br>There is no doubt he is an eclectic producer, responsible for projects like Auricular, Human Trafiic and Fusi & Johnson to name a few. But more than a producer he is known to perform as a DJ creating the most epic journeys and generating diversity with his well-known signature of exploring the atmospheric side of music.

					What can we say about this man that you don´t already know...?
					<br>For instance:
					<br>-We could say he has been on our wish list since we started our heartfelt project.
					<br>-We could say that he will probably be for many of us the highlight of the next ZNA edition.
					<br>-We could say he is one of the 1st artists to produce what we call today - Goa Trance. And that he became responsible for many of its most charismatic melodies.
					<br>-We could say that in spite of being a pioneer he has always been one of the best producers this scene has had the privilege to have.
					<br>-We could say his live performance is considered to be one of the most enthusiastic and euphoric experiences our scene has to offer.
					<br>-We could also say that for the last 3 decades he has been a strong inspiration for many of us, including artists, labels, promoters and dancing warriors.
					<br>-We could even say that his music is timeless and euphoric.</p>
					<p class="texto">But we believe that most of you already know all this so we rather tell you something you don’t yet know:
					<br>- At the ZNA Gathering 2017 he will prepare an exclusive 2h live set for our delight. We can expect all his classics and a few rare gems he kept under his private stash to use only in special moments like this one. 
					<br>So get ready to be amazed at the most euphoric dancing experience our Gathering could possibly offer you.
					<br>You see, sometimes a man is so special he needs no name....

					Merv perceives music as an instrument that allows the listener to explore unknown feelings inside the subconscious universe. 
					<br>This is what we believe to be a true psychedelic experience. To embark on such a deep journey, we have to forget preconceptions, formulas and genres and let this "magical" instrument take us on a trip through deep and uncharted soundscapes.
					<br>It´s also a known fact that he also feels (like we do with our ZNA activation), a strange connection to outer space energies which made him dedicate his artistic life to creating the strangest sci-fi soundscapes, giving us all an honest and respectful significance towards these beliefs we share.
					<br>...we feel it´s about time to have this maestro on both our stages:</p>
					<p class="texto">Producing music since the early 80´s as part of the legendary underground progressive rock band, the Ozric Tentacles, Merv founded the Eat Static project in 1989. 
					<br>He was motivated by the desire to give wings to his creative synapses and fantastic visions. We were all blessed by his success.
					<br>After 27 years of exploring the inner realm of reality and creating the best, out of range, psychedelic journeys...
					<br>-For the main-floor he is looking forward to creating an intense opening ceremony where we can all expect a true battle of "Merv VS the Machines". 
					<br>During this performance he will redefine the meaning and even the existence of musical boundaries. All for the sake of a proper psychedelic voyage.
					<br>-He will also bless us with a performance as the down-tempo Master he is, while playing at our chill stage.</p>
					<p class="texto">So do not miss this opportunity to challenge your mind and spirit. You just have to be there and set aside all musical boundaries, Eat Static will do the rest, communicating in his unique outer space language...

					<br>He was in India in the late 80´s, playing at parties when electronic music started hitting the shores of the sun-drenched beaches of Goa. He played in the very first Goa Trance Parties ever!!
					<br>In 1992 he co-founded the VOOV Experience, a party that would later become Europe’s first proper Trance Festival…
					<br>He also founded the mythical SPIRIT ZONE label in 1994. With over 180 releases to date, including over 80 artist albums and 40 compilations, his guidance and foresight, ensured many upcoming musical talents’ unprecedented exposure, most of whom became shooting stars of the global trance underground following their debut releases on the “Spirit Zone” label.
					<br>For more than two decades his sets became the climax of hundreds of festivals and parties around the globe.
					<br>His absolute knowledge and supreme taste have always created a portal to magical moments of trance. His impeccable Art and technique wrap our minds and bodies in an upward spiral of energy.

					<br>That is why we cannot imagine our 2017 edition without his amazing input.
					<br>His music is highly demanded and played in every corner of the world. His sets have proven to be one of the highlights of every dance floor he plays in.
					<br>If you pay attention to the way ATMOS’s music connects with the mind and body, you are sure to love it. 
					<br>His sets develop slowly, in an almost subliminal way. A perfect sense of timing, a great musical genius and his irrefutable great taste grant him the status of absolute master. Slow and deliberate melodies creep up into the small nooks and crannies in your mind and make them light up like fluorescent Art.

					<br>Many artists have been surprised by the energy generated by the Zambu Dancers…This is our genetic code, our ZNA!
					<br>Ticon already knows that. They understand, respect and support our vision:
					<br>A step back, into a new future!
					</p>
					<p class="texto">The moment artists realize they will be performing on our stage, they start to seek different approaches for their performances, displaying an amazing openness and respect for our vision and concept.

					It was the month of August in the year 2000 and our beloved Zambujal Forest was hosting one of the major moments this scene had the privilege to experience until then. During 4 nights and 5 days twelve thousand Goa heads who travelled from all corners of the world to celebrate Trance music surrounded by an overwhelming sense of freedom in the middle of an ancestral pine tree forest.
					</p><p class="texto">On the dawn of the 3rd day, these two young Scandinavian psy heads aka Logic Bomb got on the stage starting what many called, at the time, the best psychedelic experience ever. Why? 
					<br>Because even though they started to produce music in the mid-nineties when Goa music was at its peak, full of layers and melodies, they gave a very unique input to the scene and started to create something different from everyone else. They were not yet known by many people, since they had just edited the first couple of tracks.
					</p><p class="texto">So by adding this new musical approach which was rising from some music studios around Europe they started to create unique cutting edge psychedelic music with a lot of new production skills and sound quality which became a break-through moment for the trance scene. From that precise day, Logic Bomb became a huge reference to all the trance community, and responsible for creating many dancefloor anthems that are played all over the world by all the major DJs. 
					<br>For the next ZNA edition Jonas Perttersoon accepted the challenge to deliver a very unique performance for the groovy afternoon hours where his Logic Bomb universe will meet his Tranan soundscapes in order to give us two full hours of proper Psychedelic Pollution which will lead us in to Paradise.

					He is one of real trance "gurus" and a master musician who Dj´s and produces since the late 80’s.
					<br>He is another one of the artists who was responsible for the 1st steps and the birth of this scene. 
					<br>We say this because he was there in the very beginning with true Goa legends like Laurent and Fred Disko partying together in freedom and peace... People who lived and experienced raving at parties without the presence of electronic music... A time where the only thing that mattered to this people, was a new lifestyle shaped by the celebration of freedom and happiness trough music. A lifestyle that was about to be embraced by thousands for the years to come.
					<br>It´s not easy to track him down, as he is always travelling around the world. Despite that, we had the privilege of sharing a very special weekend on our ZNA Land with him, during this winter, where profound knowledge and experience were exchanged and a strong relationship was planted. 
					<br>It´s incredible how simple and clear his vision is and how we felt in sync with him. Our communication was far beyond words, it felt like we´d met lifetimes ago. We share common ZNA.

					<br>We all feel he is a crucial piece on what we aim to achieve with our Gathering and having such a "guru" performing for us is without any doubt a privilege we all must embrace.

					<br>With his legitimacy, experience and Art, he will provide us all with magical experience as he has the power to take us all on a trip where our egos will be left behind. Forgotten feelings will be available to us during this true, ultimate trance experience.

					Fred has been mostly retired from the scene for several years but now and then, when a gig matters to him, he accepts the challenge and goes on stage to dance with us all again. 

					<br>Since we felt his energy and powerful music were crucial for the next ZNA edition, we started to empower all his love for the psy trance and he accepted to be on stage with us again. Here he will feel again, all the energy and impact that his incredible musical legacy brings to a core psy crowd, who will rejoice with the heavy notes and growling basslines, just before the majestic notes of the rising sun hours.
					<br>He has told us, that we can expect a journey through the realms of psychedelia madness.
					<br>So, if you remember how powerful his performances were, you are welcome to experience them once again. If you never experienced Neuromotor before this will be the best moment to do it. He is really committed and excited to take us all into his Acid Dance world!!!

When you combine this with all the positive energy we will be sharing and living during those days, you will witness the truest of euphorias among the dancers. And that is the best feeling you can experience during a psychedelic trance celebration.

					There was a time when uplifting goa trance was starting to fade out and getting replaced by rolling bass lines and the birth of multiple sub-genres within the psy-trance musical spectrum. 
					<br>With so many new directions and ideas to explore some artists with amazing audio engineer skills took the initiative to start creating real breakthrough psychedelic music. One of them was the mastermind behind Hux Flux which was the breeding grounds of famous acts such as Logic Bomb and Z-Man... He was well known for producing real powerful weird music sending the listener on a weird but always colourful and awesome sounding trip. 
					<br>His quality as a musician combined with his amazing sound engineering skills, earned him the status of an artist who was creating perfect gems, taking dance-floors to a higher level of psychedelia.
					<br>He became a master in the transition between night and day; between the abstract experimental hours of the dark and the time people start feeling the gentile kiss of the sun's first rays on their bodies and souls.

					<br>Christos Tatitzikidis is the artist we awoke this time, so he can bring that quite rare old school minimal darkish environment that only these guys were able to create back in the days.
					<br>For the ZNA he will merge two of his well known musical projects into one performance. This way he will be free to mix all of his best deep powerful notes. We believe there is potential here to bend the strongest of minds.

					When we asked them (before the last edition) what the result of this combination would be, they just said:

					This unique project was conceived with the sole purpose of reviving in one unique performance the Art of two French musicians that shared the same passion and musical vision during the 90´s. 
					<br>Even though their careers as musicians and sound engineers took different paths, shifting them away from our scene, the connection they felt with this music was strong and it was inevitable that they would eventually join forces after so many years. All for the sake of what we believe has been, for the last decades, the ultimate psychedelic experience - Goa Psy Trance!  
					<br>Back in the day, they created many timeless anthems that are still played nowadays by the biggest Dj´s in the scene. Strangely enough (from our perspective) they are the kind of artists, like others, that seem to been unfairly underrated or unknown by the general psy/goa audience. But have always been highly respected by the artistic community, especially when you realize how much their music is actually played. Their special performance at the ZNA will be a golden opportunity to be delighted with all their timeless tracks made during the 90´s which have been revamped to sound proper according to today’s standards.

					Eduardo L.P., 1986, lives and works in Alpiarça, Portugal. He first fell for music aged 3, singing and playing drums. When he was 6 he was really enjoying musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis and started to develop skills playing their songs on the keyboard. Eduardo entered the Golegã regional conservatory when he was 8 to learn music, chant and classical piano. He joined philharmonic bands of Alpiarca , Carregueira and Alvega when he was 14, playing the trombone, and later becoming trombone monitor for children. At the age of 18, he acquired his first synthesizer and together with Igor Martins, a classmate from his Archaeology course, he created an electronic project named "Da Bunker Project". The two ended up making a live performance in the ancient Roman city of Tongobriga. In 2008, he formed a trance project named “ZaNNaRa” with his childhood friend Daniel Zabot. Eduardo started composing ambient in 2009 with chill-out and progressive sounds in mind. He is a storyteller who uses sounds because he believes that words put limits to the expression of his own experiences.

					Music  and oxygen have the same vital importance to her. The songs and records always inhabited her life above all. Sharing music was always one of her communication tools. First, through the piano, since her childhood, then, through the radio at the age of 16, and later her first spontaneous incursions through the art of playing the right record at the right time. With no plan nor set path. Passions take us without warning and, although she had never though of being a DJ, Selecta Alice is today one of the World Music boosters as far as DJ sets in Portugal are concerned. Curator of the Sacred Fire at Boom Festival, Selecta Alice pays homage in her sets the party and celebration of life culture through music and the ritual of dancing. The rhythms of Africa, Latin America, The Balcans and India are obligatory stops in her sound voyages around the world. Worldbeat – music of the world in its pure state or in fusion with the electronic language, shared in live sets or on the monthly broadcasts on Radio Groovalizacion.

					Tajmahal began his music career in the Factory club 1992, Lyon, and as co-manager of the Kobdo, one of the first Techno clubs in Lyon.
					<br>In 1995, he became a label DJ with the legendary TRANSPACT, and as co-writer with ASIA 2001. This collaboration produced 4 albums, of which Tajmahal contributed to 3 or 4 tracks on each. Taj is becoming better known for his long Ambient Uptempo Sets. At Soulclipse in Turkey, Taj presented a completely new downtempo live act.  In 2006 He became label manager for ELECTRIK DREAM.
					<br>Nowadays, Tajmahal splits his time in between Chill out and Progressiv Morning Trance projects  and also some More Electro/Tech/ Trance projects. His first release “Butterfly Ritual” on Electrik Dream was on his compilation Cosmik Chill – Red March 2006. In 2007 he released « Star Circus », his first album for Electrik Dream.
					<br>Currently, he is working on a chill out Ethnik project UASCA in collaboration with Dj fluxo (Quest4goa-Portugal).
					<br>Tajmahal’s style of composition can be seen as a bridge between trance and downtempo rhythms. His style is fluid and deep in meaning: his music tells the story of his feelings. When DJing, he combines his spotless technical skills with a broad, eclectic musical knowledge and an immense creativity: he is famous for telling a story and taking the crowds every step of the way towards enlightenment. This path can encompass different music styles – progressive, full on, psychedelic trance – within the same DJ set: Taj knows no boundaries in between styles and tempos.

At the time, this was a really hard thing to find...Together with their closest friends, such as Martin Freeland (MWNN), Simon Posford (Hallucinogen) and Nick Barber (Doof) they created, for almost 10 years, flawless music under The Infinity Project. During all this time they fed the minds of many of the true Goa trance rockers of that generation, helping them to experience new sensations and to push the boundaries of reality and musical perception.
					<br>In 1998 Raja Ram and Graham Wood agreed to split up in order to concentrate their creativity on other musical projects. However, here and there, they both accepted to perform as The Infinity Project.
					<br>Each one had his own vision within the universe of TIP, and as such the 2 interpretations of The Infinity Project, grew in different directions, becoming very different from each other.

					Merv perceives music as an instrument that allows the listener to explore unknown feelings inside the subconscious universe. 
					<br>This is what we believe to be a true psychedelic experience. To embark on such a deep journey, we have to forget preconceptions, formulas and genres and let this "magical" instrument take us on a trip through deep and uncharted soundscapes.
					<br>It´s also a known fact that he also feels (like we do with our ZNA activation), a strange connection to outer space energies which made him dedicate his artistic life to creating the strangest sci-fi soundscapes, giving us all an honest and respectful significance towards these beliefs we share.
					<br>...we feel it´s about time to have this maestro on both our stages:
					<br>Producing music since the early 80´s as part of the legendary underground progressive rock band, the Ozric Tentacles, Merv founded the Eat Static project in 1989. 
					<br>He was motivated by the desire to give wings to his creative synapses and fantastic visions. We were all blessed by his success.
					<br>After 27 years of exploring the inner realm of reality and creating the best, out of range, psychedelic journeys...
					<br>So do not miss this opportunity to challenge your mind and spirit. You just have to be there and set aside all musical boundaries, Eat Static will do the rest, communicating in his unique outer space language...

					He is a Swedish traveller a called Anders Palmqvist.
					<br>It was during his Asian trips back in the 90´s, having been motivated by a new generation of digital musical, living a free spirited life style that he started to produce music as a solution for the difficulty artists had back then to access new music.
					<br>He felt back then, that many travellers like him were seeking a new psychedelic musical experience.
					<br>With this reality in mind, he started to create what we believe was and still is really intelligent and futuristic music. There were not so many events in those days. Can you imagine how lucky the few ones were? Who had the honour to be in the right time and place listening to one of his rare and uncommercial performances?
					<br>With a unique sense for merging styles, he brought to his trance productions all the clean crystal quality we have been used to by Scandinavian artists, delivering in this way a completely new approach to Goa psychedelic trance music. 
					<br>Even though he is almost unknown to most of you for the last 2 decades, we really believe this will change after this performance.  You will also fall in love with his music as we did.
					<br>During his performance he will share his funky version of the Goa sound with all of us. A universe in which even Jazz and Swing might take over your body in a transcendental dance experience.

					Mark Ainley (DJ Solitare) is a DJ, who was classically trained as a pianist and who has been active in the world of psy-trance and electronica ever since his first exposure to it in the early nineties. Inspired by the legendary events he experienced and artists he met in Tokyo, Mark moved to London in 1996 and started to live and breathe trance.

					<br>Mark’s regular contributions to Dream Creation magazine won the appreciation of several of trance’s top artists for his clearly articulated perspectives on the state of psychedelic trance music and for his reviews of international events. As a result, he works to this day with many of the big labels and artists on press releases, booklet notes and compilation production. He also writes a weekly article on our ZNA Gathering page: Mark´s throwback Thursdays always focuses on artists and music which became cornerstones of our culture.

					<br>Mark has also been on the production team for the Mind Rewind series of retro trance compilations, which include vinyl-only and unreleased Goa tracks as a fundraising effort for the children’s charity Mango Tree in Goa.
					<br>Mark has also co-produced the Analog Dreams compilation on DAT Records (for whom he is a label DJ), and he also helped coordinate the release of Doof: Let's Turn On - Remixed and Remastered, which features extremely rare mixes by this legendary producer that were never before shared with anyone.

					<br>Mark's skills as a DJ were developed in close contact with some of the world’s most amazing names, such as Tsuyoshi (one of his masters and inspirers, who recently invited him to be a label DJ for Matsuri Digital), Olli Wisdom, and many others. He was a resident DJ for several events in Tokyo in the late 90s and shared stages with many of the big names out there. Mark has played around the world and currently lives in Canada.
					<br>He blew our hats off at the last ZNA, and became a part of the family for good.

					Some artists are so prolific and creative that they can't even bind themselves to a single project or style.
					<br>In the late 90´s many of them collaborated in multiple projects, creating some of the most valuable gems and thus brightening our scene’s universe.
					<br>In 1996, under the Transient banner, one such pioneer project was born in France. An artistic alliance between Kris Kylven + Live members RX Heaven and M-Rick named Element Over Nature. Inspired by the desire of merging Trance with Cyber Culture, they created a unique psychedelic sound emanating from an Industrial Cyberpunk planet.
					<br>Riddled with sci-fi samples, these absolute stomping tracks have the power to simultaneously drive a dance floor to the edge of madness and wisdom. The atmosphere is dark, but there is no sense of terror, just a quantum jump in our perception which pushes our brains into hyperspace and towards the light!

					An active Dj since the beginning of the 90´s, Dede was the head behind projects such as Spectrum which also featured Tamir from Atomic Pulse and the great MDMA Music label which he founded in 1997 and which he has now re-opened together with Ofir from Oforia.
					<br>What you might not know is that he has been supporting us since the 1st ZNA edition. Why? Because he realized that this team was about to make trance history again and even without knowing the outcome, he immediately fell in love with our concept. From that moment, he has been expressing his will to make a performance that would be engraved in every one’s minds for the years to come. And the incredible part is that only now, after 3 previous editions, has he found the perfect slot for the performance we have been trying to pull off since day 1. 
					<br>This will be a performance where Dj Dede will present us with all the investigation and dedication he has been putting in this special act, where the golden years of Israeli Full on music will be the main ingredient for an uplifting and classical musical set.
					<br>You can expect a lot of the old-school classics from the beginning of the millennium, as well as a lot of hidden gems that only an incredible Dj like him would have in his case. True musical legacy and treasure

					<p class="texto">
					Since 1993, Holeg Spies is recognised as a leader and pioneer for the fusion of musical styles. Headliner DJ of the first official electronic music tour in India, he then joined the Out Soon booking agency alongside stars Jeff Mills and Carl Cox. Experienced in international collaborations, Spies has explored cultures and sound-worlds to forge his own unique and unconventional style. From indie-rock, electronica/techno to the sounds of ancient cultures and the symphony orchestra, Spies has worked with major record companies such as Universal Japan, BMG and Polygram.
					<br>He´s been a myth within the Trance scene since its inception, making magical appearances in the most sought-after events worldwide.

					<br>Holeg Spies has composed a vast collection of works under several names: HOLEG SPIES, SPIES, SAVAGE & SPIES, OLOWEX, SPIES UNDER VON MAGNET INFLUENCE (with Von Magnet), THE STAR SHRINK SHOOTERS and KORE KOSMOU featuring Jon Klein (Siouxsie & The Banshees) and East Bay Ray (Dead Kennedys)...  and  has produced for numerous artists and labels in more than 20 countries such as Anne Clark and  Citizen aka Vitalic.

					<br>Trained at the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), Holeg created the avant-garde SPIES project in the mid 90's with Thierry Saint-Paul and Alexandra Mercier. Together, they created the multimedia art-concept "Notinism.org". Holeg Spies then created and collaborated with a series of transmediart installations. American curator David d'Heilly  wrote: "Holeg Spies' work transmits a vast Rosetta stone facilitating communication between the world of ancient thaumaturgical wisdom and our current network society".
					<br>
					<br>Introduced to Japan by Mike Maguire (Juno Reactor), Spies toured frequently over a 10-year period (1997-2007). He met director Mike Takashi in 2002 and scored an exclusive 4' trailer for his award-winning movie Ichi the Killer, inspiring a closer interest in film. Spies' first contribution to the American film industry was his music for the theatrical trailer of Michael Bay's Hitcher. In 2006, he met Patrick Savage, created the Savage & Spies composer-duo.
					<br>In our last ZNA edition, Tim Schuldt gave a memorable performance with his Aurinko style live set, but he will step it up in this next edition!  So, Mister Spies will melt into a set, all that magical chaos that was manufactured under that label, back in the day.

					<p class="texto">
					DJ Migas is one of the minds which has been with us, as we rewrite a new chapter in the international trance scene’s history.
					<br>He is highly respected among the Zambu people, who are aware of his huge contribution, not only through his incredible musical talent but also as one of the first human resources who helped to create dozens of parties and festivals around the world.  As a very creative and capable artist and craftsman, he became a valuable member of many production teams. A man you can see on stage as a master musician, and on the ground, building and organizing structures, land art, water systems, electrical grids, trusses, you name it.
					<br>He took on this role in 94 with the Good Mood team, and was a part of the inception of the Boom Festival, and all the productions around the world made by the original team in the early years.
					<br>He’s been a part of our ZNA team and resident DJ, even before day one. Always one of the first to arrive on site and one of the last to leave, a true brother and warrior.
					<br>Migas was always into music. At an early age, he started to participate in bands as a bassist in the realms of harder and darker rock sub genres.
					<br>Around 1994, he started looking at DJing and electronic sounds as a way to transmit his singular style, an experimental and unique mental type of dance music, with no boundaries. His eclectic musical taste made him fall in love with psi-trance and chill, because it could encompass all his influences and diverse tastes.
					<br>He became a top DJ and soon after, a masterful musical producer.
					<br>Whether he is DJing or playing live, his impeccable technique and virtuous ear, stand out and leave their mark.

					<br>Dj Migas, who is part of the team since the mid 90´s, realized that something could be added to the obscure nights of the ZNA Gathering. So, as the creative man he is, he felt it was about time to bring back to light the twisted musical reality he created back in the day. In times when insanity and melting minds brought a different and deeper meaning to the dancefloor.

					<p class="texto">
					Paulo has a different perception of music. Listening to him playing is a unique experience. He is, as far as we know, the only blind DJ in the Trance music culture. And as a few other visually deprived musicians, he takes the whole experience of listening to music to another level… 
					<br>His singular awareness of sounds and stunning perception, sharpened by his blindness made him a unique artist. Always different and psychedelic, ever evolving in the search for new sound dimensions and expanding the boundaries of the psychedelic music, Paulo Lopes is an outstanding figure in the psy-trance scene. 
					<br>Paulo was born in Portugal and at the early age of 6, he immigrated to France. He lost his sight in the same year due to genetic causes. Despite being blind, he developed his own passion for living: he studied classical piano until he was 15 years old. He later graduated in both Economics and History at the Paris VII University. In the end of the 80’s he got caught up in the advent of electronic dance music and the emergent raves, teknivals and parties in France and Northern Europe. Paulo began to get involved with party organization and he was one of the earliest enthusiasts of the Goa Trance scene in Paris back then. In 1992, his musical background and skills guided him into becoming a DJ. He was one of the first Portuguese trance DJs to emerge.

					He is not only one of the founders of the great Flying Rhino Records; he is also one of the most respected artists out there. 

					<br>The very first time we ever heard the name “Retrodelica”, was in the awesome compilation James made back in 1997. He masterfully revived magical tracks from the early 90’s and unknowingly set the stage for a whole scene dedicated to reviving the psy tracks of the past.
					<br>Yet, there are few people as modern and forward thinking as he is, and that’s also why he’s right at home with us.
					<br>As an active DJ for more than 20 years, James Monro is known as a bringer of joy through his emotional and rhythmic performances. 
					<br>To name his many great deeds as a musician would be exhaustive.
					<br>To say he is a kind soul is an understatement.
					<br>To say he is a brother is an honour!
					<br>James Monro is a very eclectic and open minded genius, and this prompts him to melt different genres of music into one amazing psychedelic experience.
					<br>We were honoured to have him join our ZNA team back in 2013. When he shared his vision of making this Gathering a unique and rare opportunity to embrace and celebrate our roots in a very futuristic way, we immediately resonated with it…

					<p class="texto">
					 DJ Fluxo has been a reference of Goa Psy Trance in our country since the end of the 90´s.  He was the co-founder of the great Quest4Goa label and party production company.
					<br>They produced more than 60 of the most epic parties our country ever experienced.  
					<br>Several of these were born from an amazing collaboration with the legendary and beloved Good Mood Org, and was also included in the Boom team several times. 

					<br>Pedro Matias, in spite of being one of the most respected Trance Dj´s in Portugal, co-created a downtempo project called Chilled ´C`Quence in 2004. During several years, they became one of the highlights of the chill outs in most Portuguese parties. Many years later,  we funded Exolon which is his musical “alter ego” project where he puts into sound, magical notes and all his dancefloor creativity. 
					<br>We consider Dj Fluxo one of the main ingredients of keeping the ZNA concept true to its roots. He has been a great friend of our team since the early days, and has been supporting us since day 1, without even a hint of hesitation. He even told us that in his opinion “this Gathering is the finest one, and one of the best things that has happened in the trance scene in the last years" 
					<br>Well we sure share his opinion!!! 
					<br>We feel honoured to have him on our stage once again; his sets are always a breakthrough experience probably because he pours all his heart and feelings into his sets. You can actually feel it!!
